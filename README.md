## 💻 Step 2: Run the PC Companion Agent

To enable remote Sleep, Restart, Shutdown, Terminal execution, and live CPU/RAM telemetry:

### Option A: Automatic Startup Service (Recommended)
Right-click `register-task.ps1` and select **Run with PowerShell (As Administrator)**.
*(Registers `PCCommandCenterAgent` in Windows Task Scheduler to start automatically on Windows boot).*

### Option B: Local Network (Same WiFi / LAN)
Double-click:
```text
agent\start-agent.bat
```
*(Runs on `http://localhost:48880` with your configured `AGENT_KEY` in `agent/.env`)*

### Option C: Remote Access From Anywhere (Cloudflare Tunnel)
Follow the guide in:
```text
setup-pc-tunnel.bat
```
